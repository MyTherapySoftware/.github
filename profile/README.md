MyTherapy is building modern tools to enhance mental health care. We believe technology is an extension of therapy, not a replacement.

## Bia
[Bia](https://biajourney.com) is a guided tool for learning and practicing exposure and response prevention for overcoming emetophobia. Research shows ERP is a highly effective treatment for emetophobia but getting started is incredibly challenging, scary, and there are so many questions "What if I move too fast? What if I do it wrong? Am I making progress? What if I have a setback?". Bia makes ERP easier by answering those questions, providing structure, progress tracking, daily lesson plans, reminders, and more.
